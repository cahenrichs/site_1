    <p>Hello, my name is Clint Henrichs I love to learn about differnt things involving technology. I graduated college with an Associate's degree in Computer and Network Secuity, but I soon decided that wasn't what I wanted to do full time. My main focus recently has been working on the backend of websites using Django.</p>
    <p>My first experience my working on the backend of websites came with the language of Golang. I got on online course and I built a website. I also learned about all the differnent things you need to know for the backend of a website like csrf tokens and cookies. After a while I brought my knowlege over to Django and Python. The next thing i would like to learn is flask just so I know the big python frameworks for web development.</p>
    <p>I've also been learning Linux. I went from using Windows my whole life to using Ubuntu for about a year. Now I've been using Manjaro for a little over a year and a half and I don't see myself leaving anytime soon. I find it awesome that it's all open source and less intrusive.</p>
    <p>Another key thing about me and many of the projects I have made is that I'm a huge emacs fan. In my perfect world emacs would be my full blown operating system, but due to the fact that it is single threaded and doesn't have a browser that can compete with most modern web browsers for now it will have to continue to only be 80% of my computer usage. It won't take long if you are poking around my github or my notes to notice that most of documentation and my notes are written in emacs org-mode, which is single handly the thing that made me start using emacs as I think it is my most powerful form of markup language I have ever seen. 
    <p>I'm also not just a huge fan of linux and the open source world, but I have made a concerted effort to slowly cut intrusive technologies out of my life. I haven't booted into Windows in almost 2 years and I have deleted almost all social media out of life including LinkedIn, to the dismay of many of my employers and colleagues. Even though none of these big data collecting companies are going to notice the loss of one user I think it would be unjust for me to use technologies that I do not support the practices of.</p>
