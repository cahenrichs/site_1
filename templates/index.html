    <p>Hello, my name is Clint Henrichs I love to learn about differnt things involving technology. I graduated college with an Associate's degree in Computer and Network Secuity, but I soon decided that wasn't what I wanted to do full time. My main focus recently has been working on the backend of websites using Django.</p>
    <p>My first experience my working on websites came with trying out the frontend but eventually moved tword the backend. The first language I used to work on the backend was Golang. I still like to practice with Golang just because it's also a fun and very powerful language. Soon after I found out about Django and brought all the fundamentals from Golang to Django. After a while I'd like to learn Flask so I can use both popular Python web frameworks. </p>
    <p>I really enjoy working with Django because of how use rfriendly it is in the beginning, but continues to build on itself on how difficult it can become. Another thing I enjoy about Django is all of the differnet librarys that you can use with it. It's always fun for me to find all of these new librarys and learn how to impliment it into my code. It really keeps you on your toes when working.</p>
    <p>I've also been learning Linux. I went from using Windows my whole life to using Ubuntu for about a year. Now I've been using Manjaro for a little over a year and a half and I don't see myself leaving anytime soon. I find it awesome that it's all open source and less intrusive.</p>

    <p>Overall if any of my work interests you or you would like to contact me about anything else feel free to reach out. Here is my email:</p>
